## Intro to Blender API

Blender application is made of three main modules 

* Application Module

      bpy
       data
       context
       drops
       ops
       path
       app
       utils
       types
       
Blender application module is the entire blender application itself. The bpy corresponds to the entire blender application. Delteting object, switching between edit mode and sculpting mode... everything is here.

* Standalone Module

      bgl
      blf
      bmesh
      mathutils

* Game Engine Module (Game Engine Module is emoved from blender version 2.8)

      Blender Game Engine and other engine components like Blender Internal
